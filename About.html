        <h1>2.Perfume changes throughout the day â€“ why?</h1>
        <p>Ever wondered why the smell of perfume changes throughout the day? This is due to the Top, Heart and Base notes in a perfume. When creating a fragrance, the chemistry of the skin and the raw materials used causes a perfume to evolve over time. A perfume is a very complex composition of top notes, heart notes and base notes.</p>
        <p>The top notes are the most delicate and do typically not last very long. Heart notes tend to be herbal, floral and spice notes which last longer than the top notes but you will be able to smell the base notes the longest. Base notes are usually composed from wood, amber and musk..</p>
